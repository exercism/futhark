# Tests

If you've downloaded an exercise with the CLI tool, you should see a Futhark file named after the exercise and a `test.fut` file.
This file contains all the test cases, which match those run by the test runner when you upload your solution.
Feel free to add additional test cases for experimenting.
However, modifying tests does not affect the online test-runner process.

## Local Testing

To runs an exercise's tests, open a terminal in the exercise's directory and run the `futhark test test.fut` (or `exercism test`) command.

## Further Resources

For more on testing with Futhark, refer to the [`futhark test`][test-command] documentation.
